Here are the key points I gathered from Daniel Levitin's TED talk, "How to stay calm when you know you'll be stressed":

1. **Understanding Stress Responses**: Stress leads to the release of cortisol, which can cloud thinking and impair decision-making.

2. **Utilizing Prospective Hindsight**:
   - Also known as "pre-mortem," this technique involves anticipating potential problems before they happen and planning for them.
   - It contrasts with a post-mortem, which analyzes what went wrong after a disaster.

3. **Designate Specific Spots**:
   - Create designated places for commonly lost items (like keys, passports, etc.) to reduce the chances of losing them, based on how our spatial memory works.

4. **Prepare for Travel**:
   - Take photos of important items like credit cards and documents and store them in the cloud to expedite replacements if necessary.

5. **Acknowledge Cloudy Thinking Under Stress**: Recognize that under stress, your thinking can be impaired. Systems should be in place to aid decision-making.

6. **Be Informed in Medical Decisions**:
   - When facing medical decisions, ask about crucial statistics, like the "number needed to treat" (NNT) and potential side effects.
   - Prepare questions in advance to facilitate discussions with healthcare providers.

7. **Consider Quality of Life**: 
   - Weigh options that may affect life span and quality of life, discussing these options with loved ones beforehand.

8. **Establish Safety Nets**:
   - Implement systems to minimize damage from potential failures (like installing a combination lock with spare keys).

9. **Recognize Human Flaws**: Everyone makes mistakes; it's important to anticipate failures and put preventive measures in place.

Keep in mind that the talk emphasizes the importance of proactive thinking and preparation in managing stress and making decisions. If you'd like more details on any specific point, let me know!
